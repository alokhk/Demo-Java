# Quarantine Management

Background of the Problem:
- Army establishments have large number of people residing on campus - service personnel, support personnel and families
- During the peak of the pandemic, institutional quarantine of 14/21 days is mandatory before personnel returning from leave, outstation duty, any off base activity are allowed to mingle with the general population residing in the cantonement
- Depending on the size of the establishment, this number can vary between 100 people for a small sub unit to as high as 400 or more people for a large establishment
Due to the paucity of the number of buildings available inside the cantonement that can be designated as quarantine buildings with appropriate support facilities, there is a great stress upon the organization in deciding how many individuals can be quarantined at any given time, how many quarantine facilities are available and with what occupancy rate, what is the rate of vacancy etc.
- Along with the fact that these facilities are spread over large geographical areas, it is decision problem for the command structure to correctly estimate the number of people who can be quarantined at one time and also what will be the avilability of the manpower for emergent tasks

Design:
The app replicates the process of returning manpower regestering themselves at the reception center, allocation of quarantine block, tracking of various tests and results, further isolation in case of being COVID positive and number of people being de-quarantined and available for frontline duties on a weekly basis and presents this data to different users with varying roles.

It also provides a dashboard for the command channel to keep abreast of the situation as it emerges.

The app makes use of a Firebase Realtime Database to achieve the objectives
